**crossmap** provides an extension to [**purrr**](https://github.com/tidyverse/purrr)'s family of mapping functions.
`xmap()` works like `purrr::pmap()`, but applies a function to every combination of elements in a list of inputs.

**crossmap** also includes a few other general purpose and specialized  functions for working with combinations of list elements.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **crossmap** from [GitHub](https://github.com/rossellhayes/fauxnaif) with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rossellhayes/crossmap")
```

## Usage

```{r include = FALSE}
library(purrr)
library(crossmap)
```

While `purrr::pmap()` applies a function to list elements pairwise, `xmap()` applies a function to all combinations of elements

```{r}
pmap_chr(list(1:3, 1:3), ~ paste(.x, "*", .y, "=", .x * .y))
xmap_chr(list(1:3, 1:3), ~ paste(.x, "*", .y, "=", .x * .y))
```

**crossmap** also integrates with [**furrr**](https://github.com/DavisVaughan/furrr) to offer parallelized versions of the `xmap()` functions

```{r}
future::plan("multiprocess")
future_xmap_chr(list(1:3, 1:3), ~ paste(.x, "*", .y, "=", .x * .y))
```

`cross_fit()` is an easy wrapper for an important use of **crossmap**, fitting models to subsets of data

```{r warning = FALSE}
cross_fit(mtcars, c(cyl, vs), list(wt = mpg ~ wt, hp = mpg ~ hp))
```

`cross()` finds all combinations of elements from a set of lists

```{r}
cross(number = 1:3, letter = letters[1:3])
cross(number = 1:3, letter = letters[1:3], .type = "tibble")
```

And `cross_join()` finds all combinations of the rows of data frames

```{r}
cross_join(dplyr::band_members, dplyr::band_instruments2)
```
