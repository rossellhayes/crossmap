# crossmap: Apply Functions to All Combinations of List Elements

Provides an extension to the 'purrr' family of mapping functions to
apply a function to each combination of elements in a list of inputs.
Also includes functions for automatically detecting output type in
mapping functions, finding every combination of elements of lists or
rows of data frames, and applying multiple models to multiple subsets of
a dataset.
