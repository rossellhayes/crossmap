Description: Provides an extension to the 'purrr' family of
    mapping functions to apply a function to each combination of elements
    in a list of inputs.  Also includes functions for automatically
    detecting output type in mapping functions, finding every combination
    of elements of lists or rows of data frames, and applying multiple
    models to multiple subsets of a dataset.
