Description: Provides an extension to the 'purrr' family of mapping functions to
    apply a function to each combination of elements in a list of inputs.
    Also includes general purpose functions for finding every combination of
    elements of lists or rows of data frames and a specialized function for
    applying multiple models to multiple subsets of a dataset.
